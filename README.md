<h1 align="center">Peter Steenbergen (j1nx) </h1>

Co-founder of OpenVoiceOS and creator of MycroftOS.

I design and build open-source voice AI systems focused on privacy, modularity, and embedded deployment.

My work focuses on making voice assistants that run locally, without cloud dependency, and can operate reliably on embedded hardware.
